# Bank-Loan-Prediction
Distribution of the loans is the core business part of almost every banks. The main portion the bankâ€™s
assets is directly came from the profit earned from the loans distributed by the banks. The prime objective in
banking environment is to invest their assets in safe hands where it is. Today many banks/financial companies
approves loan after a regress process of verification and validation but still there is no surety whether the
chosen applicant is the deserving right applicant out of all applicants. Through this system we can predict
whether that particular applicant is safe or not and the whole process of validation of features is automated by
machine learning technique. The disadvantage of this model is that it emphasize different weights to each factor
but in real life sometime loan can be approved on the basis of single strong factor only, which is not possible
through this system.
Loan Prediction is very helpful for employee of banks as well as for the applicant also. The aim of this
Paper is to provide quick, immediate and easy way to choose the deserving applicants. It can provide special
advantages to the bank. The Loan Prediction System can can automatically calculate the weight of each features
taking part in loan processing and on new test data same features are processed with respect to their associated
weight .A time limit can be set for the applicant to check whether his/her loan can be sanctioned or not. Loan
Prediction System allows jumping to specific application so that it can be check on priority basis. This Paper is
exclusively for the managing authority of Bank/finance company, whole process of prediction is done privately
